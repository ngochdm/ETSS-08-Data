## I. Using CARLA

### 1. Building CARLA

Use `git clone` or download the project from [CARLA Github][carlagithublink].

Then follow the instruction at [How to build on Linux][buildlinuxlink] or [How to build on Windows][buildwindowslink].

The Linux build needs for an UE patch to solve some visualization issues regarding Vulkan. Those already working with a Linux build should install the patch and make the UE build again using the following commands.

```sh
# Download and install the UE patch  
cd ~/UnrealEngine_4.24
wget https://carla-releases.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Linux/UE_Patch/430667-13636743-patch.txt ~/430667-13636743-patch.txt
patch --strip=4 < ~/430667-13636743-patch.txt

# Build UE
./Setup.sh && ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh && make
```
